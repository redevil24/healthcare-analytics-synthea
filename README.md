# Healthcare Analytics with Synthea

**Role**: Data Preparation & Dataset Engineering

This repository contains my contribution to a Big Data mini-project, focusing on preparing a synthetic healthcare dataset (Synthea) for distributed healthcare analytics.

## What I did
- Prepared 6 core Synthea tables (patients, encounters, conditions, procedures, medications, organizations)
- Partitioned the dataset into **8 nodes** based on organization and city mapping
- Simulated **schema heterogeneity and privacy constraints** across data sources
- Exported analytics-ready outputs and validated schema consistency

## Dataset
- Synthea Synthetic Patient Records

## Notes
- Group mini-project for Big Data course (HCMUT Master Program)
- This repository focuses only on the **data preparation & dataset engineering** component
- Full datasets are not included to keep the repository lightweight
